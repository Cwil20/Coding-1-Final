# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
This website is a simple website. The images used in the sliding carousel are just images that I like and think look cool. The Aboout page has a picture of me and a short paragraph about me. The contact page has a fake phone numnber and email. All the text has a font family of franklin gothic medium and a color of white. The navbar and footer use a gray color, which is acutally the same color used in the flatiron webstire (#212121), and the body has a background color of black. The headings in the about and contact page are bolded and have a horizontal line below it. The logo was actually just made in Google Docs. I just put my initials in a cursive font with white text and a black background, took a screenshot, and then removed the black background so it would look good against the gray background.
